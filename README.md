Sparse fuzzy c-means (SFCM) reforms traditional FCM (fuzzy c means) to deal with high dimensional data clustering, based on Witten's sparse clustering framework. SFCM embeds feature selection into FCM via sparse weighting and makes model interpretation easier. For more details, please refer to the following paper.
